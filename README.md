# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Algorithms
Reading the ["Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-On"](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/deep-reinforcement-learning-hands?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788834247) of Maxim Lapan, decided to reimplement some of the algorithms by my own. The reason was to familirize with the algorithms and have my own implentation for future needs.

Algorithms:
1. Cross-Entropy
